- Scrum meetings went well and everyone participated
- We had more daily meetings on this sprint (also on Monday and Wednesday)

### Learned
*What did we learn from the last sprint?*

- We don't want to waste time on insignificant features, because it slows down the project's progress
- We want to try not to overstep from our task, and we want to stay in the scope
- We want to read the material more careful and not to overdo outselves too much

### Lacked

- We didn't have time to polish some features

### Longed for
*What could we have done better in the last sprint?*
