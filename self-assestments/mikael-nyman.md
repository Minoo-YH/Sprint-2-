# Self-Assessment

- **Member name:** Mikael Nyman
- **Contribution area:** I worked on the backend, specifically the user profile.

---
 
### 1. Functionality
- **Does the code meet the requirements?**
  - [x] Does it implement all specified features you were responsible for?  
  - [x] Are edge cases handled (e.g., invalid data, duplicates)?  
  - [ ] Are there any bugs or unexpected behaviors?  

- **Integration**
  - [x] Does your code work correctly with other parts of the application?  
  - [x] Are inputs and outputs managed appropriately?  

---

### 2. Code Quality
- **Readability**
  - [x] Is your code easy to understand for other developers?  
  - [x] Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?  

- **Reusability**
  - [x] Can your code or parts of it be reused elsewhere in the application?  
  - [x] Is logic modular and separated from unrelated concerns?  

- **Comments and Documentation**
  - [ ] Are there comments explaining complex logic?  
  - [x] Is there documentation for how to use your code unit?  

---

### 3. Performance
- **Efficiency**
  - [ ] Are there any unnecessary operations or performance bottlenecks?  
  - [ ] Is the code optimized for larger datasets or high traffic (if applicable)?  

---

### 4. Overall Assessment
- **Strengths**  
  - The code is readable and well tested with Postman. Endpoint functionalities are clearly documented in the readme file.

- **Areas for Improvement**  
  - Some comments could help with understanding the thought process behind the code, but I think most code is generally more readable if it's not full of comments.

- **Action Plan**  
  - In the future I should comment the code more if something isn't obvious from just reading the code itself.
